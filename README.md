You know how contemporary christian music is really repetetive? I started this project to see if I could analyze the words in different kinds of music to see how true that claim is. 
So far, the code tells you the number of uses for each word in a song, tells you the total number of unique words, tells you the unique words per minute, and prints out a little histogram to help you visualize how repetetive the song is.
