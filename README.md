You know how contemporary christian music is really repetetive? I started this project to see if I could analyze the words in different kinds of music to see how true that claim is. 
So far, the code tells you the number of uses for each word in a song, tells you the total number of unique words, tells you the unique words per minute, and prints out a little histogram to help you visualize how repetetive the song is. 

For instance, Stairway To Heaven has 162 unique words, about 20 unique words per minute, and it's histogram looks like this. The correct interpretation of this histogram is that there are about 100 words which are only used a single time, and on the other end of the graph, there is only a single word which is used 17 times (the word "the").
